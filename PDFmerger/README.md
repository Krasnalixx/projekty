# Chess Game

Welcome to my Chess Game, a fully interactive digital chess experience built with PyQt5. This project consists of three main modules that handle everything from the graphical user interface to the game mechanics.

## Modules

1. **main.py**: This is the core file of the game, where the main application is run. It includes the rules of the game and sets up the graphical user interface (GUI). It utilizes PyQt5 to manage game windows, dialogs, and other GUI components.

2. **figures.py**: This file contains the definitions of the chess pieces and classes related to piece promotion and reviewing past moves. It plays a crucial role in defining the behavior of each piece on the chessboard.

3. **resources_rc.py**: This module handles the graphical resources, storing representations of the chess pieces used in the game's GUI.

## Resource Management

This project utilizes a `.rc` file (`resources_rc.py`) to manage the graphical assets, such as images of the chess pieces. These resources are compiled from a Qt Resource Collection file (.qrc), which allows the application to efficiently load and access these assets at runtime. This method ensures that all visual elements are neatly organized and easy to update or modify, enhancing the maintainability of the game's user interface.

## Dependencies

To run this game, you will need Python and PyQt5. Here's how you can install PyQt5 if you haven't done so yet:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

## Running the Game

To start the game, navigate to the directory containing the game's files and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Game Features

- **Standard Game View**: The traditional game view presents a clear and intuitive interface, allowing players to focus on the game without unnecessary distractions. Below is the standard view of the game interface.

- **Game Options**: Before starting a match, players can choose their desired game settings, such as the time control. These include fast-paced Bullet and Blitz formats, traditional Rapid, or Increment time modes to accommodate different styles of play.

## Game Analysis

- **Game Review**: After completing a game, players have the opportunity to reflect on and analyze their gameplay. This can be accomplished by navigating through each move made during the game using the 'Next move' and 'Previous move' buttons. This functionality provides a platform for detailed post-game analysis, enabling players to learn from their games.

- **Move List**: Throughout the game, all moves are recorded and displayed in a dedicated section of the interface. This feature serves as a move history log, allowing players to keep track of the game's progress, review the actions taken, and refine their strategies for future games.
